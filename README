My configuration files. Much is stolen from the following persons:

http://github.com/sartak/conf
http://github.com/eckankar/rcfiles
http://github.com/mortenbp/config
http://github.com/freaken/

To install:
Make sure you have at least the basic programs: xmonad, rxvt-unicode, oh-my-zsh
Run install.sh - this creates symlinks to your home directory for all the config files
